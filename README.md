# TwinCities

The website can be accessed at https://minhla.github.io/TwinCities/

This is a project in the module Data Schemas and Applications, UWE Bristol 19-20. 

We were given a task to create a website showing the map of the two cities that are twinned together. Twin cities are a special case of two cities or urban centres that are founded in close geographic proximity and then grow into each other over time, losing most of their mutual buffer zone (Wikipedia). 

The website is able to show the geographical map of two cities, and on those maps are markers pointing at several points of interest in those cities (museums, airports, etc..). This project uses PHP, HTML/CSS and Javascript. The data of the POIs is stored in a locally hosted MySQL database.
